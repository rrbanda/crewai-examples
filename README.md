# **LeopardPontDesArtsAgent Example**

This example demonstrates a **CrewAI-based** pipeline that:

1. Uses **DuckDuckGo** to gather facts about leopard top speeds and the length of Pont des Arts.  
2. Calls **local Ollama** running **Mistral** (via simple HTTP) to **estimate** how many seconds a leopard at full speed would take to cross Pont des Arts.
